# Conversational AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial
Transformers have taken the AI research and product community by storm. We have seen them advancing multiple fields in AI such as NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics. In this talk/tutorial, I will be giving some background in Conversational AI, NLP and Transformers based Large Scale Language Models such as BERT and GPT-3. I will walk the audience through hands-on examples and how they can leverage such techniques in their applications.


## Installation and Pre-requisite
- git clone git@github.com:chagri/Transformers-Tutorial.git
- cd Transformers-Tutorial
- pip install -r requirements.txt

If you can get OpenAI GPT-3, great! This is optional.
